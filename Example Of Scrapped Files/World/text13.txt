ISLAMABAD: The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Thursday filed an application with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), seeking the disqualification of Asif Ali Zardari, the country’s former president and co-chairperson of the opposition Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), for concealing his assets.


The timing of the move coupled with the upcoming decision of the anti-corruption court in two graft references against former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The court has reserved its judgement against Sharif till December 24.

The application against 63-year-old Zardari was filed by PTI Sindh MPA Khurram Sherzaman with the Provincial Election Commissioner, stating that the former president had failed to declare an apartment he allegedly owns in Belaire Condominiums located at 524 East 72nd Street in New York, in his nomination form for the 2018 general elections.

Zardari was elected as a member of the National Assembly from Shaheed Benazirabad constituency in the southern Sindh province.

As per the past precedent, Zardari can be disqualified from holding public office for not being “honest and righteous”, the precondition for being a member of parliament under Article 62 (1)(f) the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Rules of the Election Commission of Pakistan. Ex-PM Nawaz Sharif was disqualified by a five-judge Supreme Court bench on July 28, 2017, in the Panama Papers case under the same provision.
