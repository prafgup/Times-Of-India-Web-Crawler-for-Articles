Hours after accusing IAF chief B S Dhanoa of lying on the Rafale deal, former oil minister M Veerappa Moily partially retracted his statement. 

 Speaking to the media in Hyderabad, Moily had initially said the IAF chief was "suppressing the truth", Moily claimed that Dhanoa, along with Rafale manufacturers, had visited Indian defence public sector HAL headquarters days before India and France announced in Paris that there will be an inter-governmental agreement and found the PSU a "competent body with necessary expertise". 

The comment alluded to Congress's allegation that the government ousted HAL from the Rafale deal to give the offset contracts to Anil Ambani's firm as "cronyism".

 Later, referring to the IAF chief, Moily said, "The question is, is he justifying it on the basis of the Supreme Court judgment which is flawed? In the light of this, whether the IAF chief can again certify that this is fine. I am asking him that question. I never called him a liar. If this HAL is fine... Both of them cannot be fine." 

 The government has said that the deal, as under negotiation during the UPA tenure, failed to resolve differences between HAL and manufacturer Dassault over the man-hours needed for maintenance, significantly impacting pricing. 

 In a statement, Dhanoa on Wednesday backed the apex court judgment which recently cleared the Rafale deal challenged before it and slammed the criticism as political. tnn
