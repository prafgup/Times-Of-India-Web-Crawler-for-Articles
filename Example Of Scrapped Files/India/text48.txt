NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Consumer Protection Bill which provides for recall of faulty products, allows buyers to seek compensation for defective items or deficiency in services and prescribes penalties for manufacturing or selling adulterated items. The penalty and jail term has been linked to impact of adulterated products on human health with a proposal for seven years to life imprisonment and at least Rs 10 lakh fine in case of death caused by any adulterated products. 


The proposed law, which is being overhauled after a gap of 32 years, has provisions for imposing fines on celebrities for endorsing false or misleading advertisements and penalties including jail term for manufacturers for committing the offence. The bill also provides for consumers to file complaints with the consumer commissions at the place of residence or work and not from where he purchased product or availed a service, which is the present norm.

Seeking to empower consumers and protect them from getting shortchanged by manufacturers and marketing agencies, the bill, which awaits approval of Rajya Sabha to become a law, proposes setting up of a Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) which will have the power to take suo motu cognisance of offence or malpractice and act on consumer complaints to act against the violators. 

 It will also have the power to file "class action" complaints before the consumer disputes redressal commissions in case a large number of people are impacted.
