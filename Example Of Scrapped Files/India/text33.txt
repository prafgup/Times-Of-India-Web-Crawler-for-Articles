RANCHI: CPM politburo member Brinda Karat refused to comment on whether the party will tie-up with the Congress party in the"Mahagatbandhan" at the national level for Lok Sabha 2019 but said it will go for state-specific alliances. 


Karat, who is also the party's Jharkhand in-charge, said, "We want a strong alliance to defeat the communal BJP. We have envisaged a strong alliance but our partners will vary from one to state to another in the 2019 parliamentary polls." 

She said her party did not get any communication from opposition parties in Jharkhand to join the proposed Mahagatbandhan (grand alliance), adding that CPM will team up with other Left parties to contest the polls in the state, but she did not divulge any seatsharing details.
