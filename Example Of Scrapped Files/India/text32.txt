MUMBAI: An internal BJP survey reveals that even if it contests the general election in alliance with the Shiv Sena, a repeat of the 2014 performance is not likely in the state. 


 The BJP-Shiv-Sena combine had secured 40 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the 2014 election. Currently, the BJP has 22 of the 48 seats, the Shiv Sena has 18, the Congress holds two, the NCP has 5, and one seat is held by the Swabhimani Paksha . "If we contest the Lok Sabha polls jointly, we will win fewer than 30 to 34 seats and if we contest separately, the BJP may win 15 to 18 seats, while the Shiv Sena will be able to secure five to eight seats. In that event, the Congress-NCP combine will win 22 to 28 seats," a former BJP minister said. 

 The former BJP minister said that to avoid a dismal performance, BJP president Amit Shah was insisting on an alliance with the Shiv Sena. "Shah felt that all-out efforts should be made to reach out to Shiv Sena and ensure that BJP-Shiv-Sena repeats the 2014 performance."
