NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley clashed with Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Thursday over GST, saying the UPA had left behind a legacy of 31% indirect tax on most items and that a single slab, suggested by Congress, was indeed unworkable as it would mean equating luxury and sin goods with common items. 


 Jaitley reacted to Rahul Gandhi's tweet following PM Narendra Modi's statement that 99% of items would be under 18% rate, including most goods and services availed by common people. "The Congress party has finally jolted Narendraji from his deep slumber on Gabbar Singh Tax. Though still drowsy, he now wants to implement what he had earlier called the Congress party's 'Grand Stupid Thought'. Better late then never Narendraji," Rahul tweeted.

"The UPA had left behind a legacy of 31% indirect tax on most items. GST has already reduced 334 items to 12% and 18% slab. Wasn't the 31% tax an oppressive idea, a stupid one at that," Jaitley responded, also on Twitter.

"A single slab GST argued by the Congress president is indeed a stupid idea. Luxury and sin items can't be taxed at the same rate as the common man's item," the finance minister said.
