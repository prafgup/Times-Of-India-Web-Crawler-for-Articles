BEIJING: China’s state councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi is expected to arrive on Friday in New Delhi on a two-day visit during which he will co-chair a meeting on developing people-to-people relations between the two countries.


The government recently invited Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, to start 5G trails in India. Huawei is desperately seeking new markets at a time it faces stiff resistance in the Western world over allegations that it poses security risks.

The Indian move amounts to extending a hand of friendship at a crucial time when the US and Chinese governments are engaged in a bitter quarrel over the recent detention of a top Huawei official in Canada at the instance of the US. The official was later released on bail but has not yet been cleared of the charge of selling components to Iran in defiance of a US ban.

But China is unlikely to be satisfied with the Huawei gesture and New Delhi’s decision to relax visa rules for Chinese who visit India to attend conferences and wants India to accept its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). New Delhi is opposed to it because one stretch of the BRI passes through disputed Pakistanoccupied Kashmir. But China has stepped up efforts to persuade Myanmar and Nepal to implement the programme and build indirect pressure on India to accept it.

Besides meeting external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and possibly PM Narendra Modi, Wang will attend an India-China Film Festival in New Delhi on Friday . The effort is to leave behind the shadow of the 73-day Doklam border dispute which ended in August 2017.

Efforts to build people-topeople relationships picked up momentum after the informal summit between PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Wuhan last summer.
