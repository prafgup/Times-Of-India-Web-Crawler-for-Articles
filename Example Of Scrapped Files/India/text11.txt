KOLKATA: Expressing concern over the prevailing atmosphere of "fear and hatred" in the country, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah on Friday said no religion was greater than the other.


Abdullah, while speaking at a programme here, said people must strive to build a country where all religions were equally revered.

"No religion is greater than the other. When I look into your eyes, I see my God, when you look into my eyes, you see your God. Because there is no difference. The creator is the same," the veteran politician said at the 11th edition of 'World Confluence of Humanity, Power and Spirituality' here.

The National Conference (NC) leader urged people to understand and respect people of other communities.

"Have we been able to build that India where we can survive together in happiness? No. We have created an India where there is fear and hatred... Please love each other and understand each other's pains," he said.

Observing that no one cared about religion during blood transfusion in hospitals, Abdullah said, "Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians have the same blood flowing through their veins."

He apprehended that a day might arrive when the oppressed class revolts against the politicians and privileged sections for not giving them their due.

"As a nation, we must try and remove class and communal disparities and treat our neighbours with kindness and love," he added.
