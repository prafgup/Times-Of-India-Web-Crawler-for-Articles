NEW DELHI: Congress and NCP latched on to actor Naseeruddin Shah's comment that the "death of a cow has more significance than that of a police officer" to attack BJP, saying it was vitiating the country's atmosphere for political gains. BJP, on the other hand, dubbed Shah's views as an attempt to defame the government as part of a conspiracy ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. 


"We concur, do not fear the hate, fight it," Congress tweeted from its official handle. Party leader Prithviraj Chavan told reporters in Indore that secular citizens were living in an "atmosphere of fear" because of BJP's attempts to polarize people on religious grounds. 

"We have a fear that if the Narendra Modi government comes back to power after the Lok Sabha elections, then neither the Constitution nor democracy will survive," he added. 

BJP dismissed Shah's comments as a "PR stunt." "This is not a tolerance and intolerance debate. This is a PR stunt," party spokesperson Sambit Patra said. Party MP Prahlad Patel added, "This country has given so much to actors like Shah... he had earned name, fame and respect among Indians. Still if he feels that this country is not safe, he should take a call and settle in the country of his choice."
