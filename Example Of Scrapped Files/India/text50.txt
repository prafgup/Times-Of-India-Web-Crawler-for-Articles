NEW DELHI: Senior Congress functionary and former oil minister M Veerappa Moily triggered a fresh controversy over the Rafale deal on Thursday when he accused IAF chief B S Dhanoa of “lying” after the Air Force commander hailed the Supreme Court order upholding the defence deal. After his remarks triggered a furore, Moily said he had never called the officer a liar. 


The chief of air staff had said that the SC had delivered a “fine judgment” and warned against politicisation of defence purchases, pointing to the delays in acquisition that followed the Bofors howitzer scandal. Reacting to the IAF chief ’s remarks, Moily lashed out, saying: “Today, to say it is fine (the SC judgement)... I think that IAF chief is not fine... he is not fine, he is lying. He is suppressing the truth. He is a party to suppressing the truth.” 

The Congress leader’s comments reflected the ire in the party over several senior IAF officers vouching for the suitability of Rafale and also backing the selection process. Congress backed Moily, saying the government is using service chiefs for political warfare. Moily’s statement predictably set off a row between BJP and Congress. 

“Veerappa Moily of Congress just now called the IAF chief ‘a LIAR’ all because he said that India needs Rafale jets! Till now they have called the SC, the government, French government and president and Dassault CEO liars,” tweeted Amit Malviya, head of BJP’s IT cell.
