MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Thursday announced a cap on the outstanding stock of external commercial borrowings (ECB) at 6.5 per cent of GDP at current market prices.


Based on the gross domestic product (GDP) figures at March-end 2018, the soft limit works out to USD 160 billion for the current financial year, the RBI said in a statement.

"The outstanding stock of ECB as on September 30, 2018, stood at USD 126.29 billion," it said.

The decision to have a "rule-based dynamic limit" for outstanding stock of ECB at 6.5 per cent of GDP at current market prices has been taken in consultation with the government, the RBI added.
