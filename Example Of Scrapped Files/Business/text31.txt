TOKYO: SoftBank shares sank 15% on debut, wiping $9 billion off their value, as investors sold off the telecom operator after its record IPO on worries about a recent service outage and its exposure to Chinese telecoms gear maker Huawei.


The poor start for unit of tech investment giant Soft-Bank Group meant that for Japan’s mom-and-pop investors concerns about company and the nation’s telecoms market trumped the appeal of the group’s charismatic founder Masayoshi Son.

Such a debut is uncommon in the Japanese IPO market. Of 82 IPOs so far this year, SoftBank’s $23.5-billion float was only the seventh to open below the offering price. Among recent major IPOs, Japan Display was the only one to flop, suffering a fall in its 2014 debut.

“There was a disruption in its network early this month as well as Huawei’s issues. There hasn’t been good news involving Soft-Bank recently,” said Tetsuro Ii, CEO at Commons Asset Management.

Shares of SoftBank closed at 1,282 yen, 14.5% lower than its IPO price of 1,500 yen and giving the telco a market cap of about 6.1 trillion yen — about 1.1 trillion yen below its value at the time of the IPO. Shares opened trading at 1,463 yen.

“It was beyond our expectations that the shares would fall that much,” said a senior executive at one of SoftBank’s domestic lead underwriters, declining to be named since he was not authorised to discuss the matter with the media. Soft-Bank shares were the most heavily traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section, as amid heightened risk aversion the benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell to a nine-month low, closing down 0.6%. SoftBank Group lost 1%%.
