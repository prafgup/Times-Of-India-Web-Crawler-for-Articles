NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday announced a significant rampup in its capital infusion plan for public sector banks (PSBs), with Rs 83,000 crore to be provided over the next few months, taking the recapitalisation amount during the current financial year to Rs 1.06 lakh crore.


The statement from finance minister Arun Jaitley came hours after he sought Parliamentary nod for a fresh capital infusion of Rs 41,000 crore, over and above the Rs 65,000 crore he had budgeted for. So far, Rs 23,000 crore has already been released by the ministry.



The demand for fresh funds for PSBs was part of the supplementary demand for grants moved in Parliament, which entails an additional spending of around Rs 86,000 crore although the cash outgo would be limited to Rs 15,000 crore. It also includes fresh equity of Rs 2,300 crore for cash-guzzler Air India, which had received Rs 1,630 crore earlier in the fiscal year.

Financial services secretary Rajiv Kumar told reporters that priority will be to provide funds to three-to-four banks that are not fully compliant with RBI norms related to NPAs and capital but have not slipped into the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework (for weak banks that would inhibit their ability to expand). The other focus segment is banks that have shown improvement on some of the PCA parameters and are now profitable such as Corporation Bank and Bank of Maharashtra.

The fund allocation would also be linked to the ability of these banks to raise equity from the market and also get rid of noncore assets. “This (fund infusion) will increase the lending capacity of public sector banks as well as help some of them come out of RBI’s watch list,” Jaitley said.
