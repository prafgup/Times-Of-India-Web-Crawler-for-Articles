NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed the petition filed by Associated Journals Ltd(AJL), publisher of National Herald, challenging the eviction order of October 30. The court has given two weeks time to AJL to vacate the premises at ITO. 


The Centre in its eviction order had mentioned a violation of 56-year-old lease conditions by the publisher. 

Justice Sunil Gaur, who was hearing the matter, had reserved his decision on November 22 on AJL's plea against the government's October 30 notice.

The court on the last date had asked the Centre what was the justification to re-enter the premises now when publication of National Herald has commenced.

The Centre and the Land and Development Office (L&DO) had told the court that re-entry notice was issued as it had initiated the proceedings back in 2016 when no printing or publishing activity was going on.

All the procedures have been followed to the hilt before issuing the notice for re-entry to AJL, it had said.

AJL had opposed the Centre's stand, saying that publication of web editions began in 2016 and the issue of absence of printing press in the premises was not raised then.

It had said the government kept silent till April 2018 when it again sent a notice for inspection and in which it had said that it was coming to check breaches mentioned in notice of October 10, 2016.
