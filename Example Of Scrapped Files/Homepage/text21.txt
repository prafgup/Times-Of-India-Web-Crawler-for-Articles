It wouldn’t be wrong to say that actress Tanushree Dutta Dutta’s allegations of sexual harassment against Nana Patekar was somewhere the beginning of #MeToo movement in India, especially Bollywood. Many prominent names have come up who have been accused of sexual misconduct. And one of the shocking names has been that of Alok Nath. 

According to reports in India Today, a hearing took place in the Vinta Nanda and Alok Nath case yesterday where the senior actor’s advocate DN Goburdhun, has lashed out at Vinta Nanda and called her a delusional complainant and a woman who drank alcohol, indulged in drugs and had relationships with married men with children. 
He reportedly said that she probably wanted some unrelenquished love from the actor and quashed her complaint as mere publicity. Not just this, the advocate also said that Vinta wanted to create marital discord between Nath and his wife as she forced the veteran actor to shoot a kissing scene in the serial at one point of time two decades ago despite the actor’s objection as his wife did not approve of such scenes.

D N Goburdhun has also reportedly termed the writer-producer's rape allegation an imaginative story and that she did not cooperate with the police during the investigation and was busy attending film festivals.

To all these allegations, Nanda's lawyer Dhruti Kapadia reportedly objected saying that he only wanted to do character assassination of Vinta.
