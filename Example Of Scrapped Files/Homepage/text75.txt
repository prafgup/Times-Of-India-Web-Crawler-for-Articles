Shah Rukh Khan’s response to Anushka Sharma’s heartfelt post will bring a smile on your face!

Anushka Sharma made an impression on our minds with her simplistic looks and beautiful performance as ‘Taani’ in ‘Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi’ opposite Shah Rukh Khan and since then there has been no looking back for the actress. Now, as she has successfully completed a decade in this industry, she expressed her gratitude with a heartfelt note and this is how Shah Rukh Khan reacted to it!

Her mentor, co-star and friend Shah Rukh Khan replied on her post saying that he is privileged to have worked with her and that she has made him a better actor.
