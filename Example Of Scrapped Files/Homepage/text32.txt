NEW DELHI: Observing that even convicted prisoners have fundamental rights, the Delhi high court on Friday released former Youth Congress leader Sushil Kumar Sharma, who killed his wife Naina Sahni in 1995 and tried to dispose of her body by burning it in a tandoor.


A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal set aside the order of Lt Governor and the Sentence Review Board of Delhi govt refusing to release Sharma on remission.

He has spent continuous 23 and half years in jail since the murder and the court noted that Delhi Police failed to show a single cogent reason why he shouldn't be reformed and allowed to integrate back with society.

HC also took into account his good conduct in jail and a thumbs up from govt's social welfare department and his chief probation officer - all of whom had recommended his premature release from jail.

The court noted that Sharma's aged and infirm parents need him in their twilight years and he can be rehabilitated.

As per prosecution, the convict had shot his wife Naina with his licensed revolver on the night of July 2, 1995, taken her body to a restaurant, chopped it into pieces and tried to burn them in the restaurant's oven, leading the case to be popularly called 'tandoor murder case'.

The Supreme Court had commuted to life imprisonment the death penalty awarded to Sharma by a trial court in 2003 and upheld by the high court in 2007, saying the murder was the outcome of "strained personal relationship" and the convict was "not a confirmed criminal".

While reducing the sentence awarded to him, the apex court had said that "life sentence is for the whole of remaining life of Sharma subject to remission granted by the appropriate government under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
