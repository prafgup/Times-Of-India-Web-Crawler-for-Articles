If you do not want to use use your old artificial Christmas tree and install a new one this season, hereâ€™s how you can recycle it into a perfect wreath! A wreath is a symbol of the happy life cycle representing God - the infinite, with no end or beginning. Wreaths are hung specially on the door during Christmastime but you can hand them on the window or anywhere on the walls too. The wreath is generally made of evergreens, most often pine branches or holly. They can be real or artificial too.


What you need:

1 old artificial Christmas tree
1 circular base for wreath
Decoratives
Glue or glue gun
Ribbon


How to make it:

1. Cut off the branches from the old artificial Christmas tree and collect them in one place.





2. Wrap the twigs around the circular frame one by one. Wrap them densely without leaving any gaps.






3. If you think they are falling off, stick them with glue gun.





4. Decorate it with ribbons, artificial berries, Christmas balls and other decorative.








Tie a fine wire around to hang it.
