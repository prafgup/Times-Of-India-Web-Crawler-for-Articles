In a series of big fat Indian weddings, the Ambanis had the world awestruck when they called on international sensation and Grammy-winning singer, Beyonce to Udaipur for their daughter Isha Ambani’s wedding to Anand Piramal. Videos from the elaborate festivities saw the singer not only sing her hit romantic numbers but also putting up an entire concert, complete with dazzling Indian inspired outfits.

While the singer didn’t reveal too much from the closed door function, except for sharing a few photos for herself, today she generously served up some breathtaking photos from her first visit to the country and a video to go with it. What seemed to have caught the attention of the Indian audience, was the background score of the famous Punjabi song ‘Mundian To Bach Ke’used in her video. Interestingly, the song also featured on Beyoncé and Jay-Z's On the Run II tour. 

Check out the video and photos below:
