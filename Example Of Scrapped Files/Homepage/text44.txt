MUNGER: Culling of birds had been ordered in four villages of Munger district as outbreak of bird flu had been confirmed in those areas, a senior state government official said on Friday.

Divisional commissioner, Munger, Pankaj Kumar Pal said though bird flu had been confirmed in some areas of Munger district, no case of avian influenza in any person had been reported so far.


Following reports of birds dying in some villages under Ghoraho Panchayat, samples were sent to a medical lab in Kolkata for tests wherein strains of the H5N1 virus were confirmed, he said.

"Culling of birds has, therefore, been ordered in four villages falling under the panchayat Chakhand, Amaiya, Belsira and Aphroj. A central team has reached the villages with the necessary paraphernalia. Besides, those in the poultry business are being compensated," Pal told mediapersons.

"Although no humans have so far been found to be afflicted by the virus, antiviral drug Tamiflu is being made available in the affected region as a precautionary measure. An advisory has also been issued asking the people to avoid coming into contact with any migratory wild birds or consumption of their meat," the commissioner added.
