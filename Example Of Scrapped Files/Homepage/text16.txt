Bollywood actor Arjun Rampal has been slapped with a criminal case due to non-payment of dues. According to a report in Deccan Chronicles, a company names YT Entertainment Limited has filed a criminal complaint against Arjun as the actor has failed to pay the amount of Rs. 1 crore with 12 percent interest per annum.

The report suggest that Rampal has taken a loan from the company on 9th May this year with a promise to repay it within 90 days however the post-dated cheque given to the company was dishonored leading the company to slap Arjun with a criminal case under the Negotiable Instruments Act for the recovery of the money.

The company which lended money to Arjun is also funding films and had funded Arjun in a much lesser rate as compared to others. If reports are to be believed than the company will have all the right over any amount paid to Arjun till their dues are recovered.
