KANPUR: IIT-Kanpur administration has decided on terminating 135 students from the institute for failing to perform well in academics. The decision was taken in the senate meeting held on campus on Monday.

The university administration termed the termination to be temporary as any final decision would be taken in the next senate meeting on December 31.

Calling the termination routine, deputy director IIT Kanpur Manindra Agarwal said, "135 students have been terminated for failing to perform well in academics. It is temporary. These students will get a chance to appeal for reinstatement. Those who failed to do well even in the past and have a poor track record, will be terminated permanently. Others would be reinstated."

"The students have got a week's time to appeal against their termination. Their appeal would be heard during the senate meeting following which a final decision would be taken. Many a time students are unable to perform well due to sickness or other unavoidable reasons. Such students have a good track record otherwise so usually they get a chance to study again in their respective courses", Prof Agarwal added.
