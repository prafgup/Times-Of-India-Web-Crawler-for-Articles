Speaking about his preparations to play Bauua Singh on-screen, Shahrukh revealed that the idea was to see if a vertically challenged person could make anyone else feel shorter than him.

The actor had to concentrate on his body language very much. SRK had to take smaller strides as if he moved at his regular pace, it would appear that he is moving too fast when matched with Bauua. The actor also told that while shooting for the dance sequence with Salman Khan, he had to dance slower to match his steps.

VFX was also a big challenge while shooting for the movie. The makers were left deliberating on various scenes whether they got it right or not. SRK also said that he believes the concept of character consistency is crap. The character would do what the makers wanted it to. So, they retained the discrepancies.
