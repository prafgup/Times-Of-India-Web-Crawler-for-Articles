Making the most of the task, contestants are seen voicing out their thoughts which they have held onto for past so many weeks. While, Surbhi Rana calls Deepak Thakur dual-faced, Sreesanth tells him that he is very good at playing with people‚Äôs emotions. Dipika Kakar tells Deepak he forgot humanity while playing game and even if he goes on to be a winner for her he will be the biggest failure. 

That‚Äôs not all when Surbhi Rana sits with headphone, Deepak calls her fake and a chameleon who changes colours. Sreesanth, who has never got along well with Surbhi taunts her by saying that she betrayed his trust and misused it when he confided in her about the slap-gate controversy to make her the captain.

The task is played for ticket to finale and whoever wins it will directly enter finale.

It will be interesting to see if the housemates are able to survive the testing time and who wins the ticket to finale.
