INDORE:The paths of Indore doctor Akhilesh Dubey and Chennai’s Ananthraman would have crossed as they waited to board Indigo’s flight to Chennai on the night of December 14. The Tamilian wouldn’t have known then that his life would be in Dr Dubey’s hands only an hour later, 35,000 feet in the air.


Around 9.10pm, Ananthraman suffered a heart attack and slumped unconscious in his seat. His neighbour raised the alarm and the cabin crew immediately made an announcement, asking if there was a doctor on board. Dr. Dubey raised his hand and was taken to the man. “We had crossed Hyderabad and were on our way to Chennai, when the man suddenly fell unconscious,” Dubey, who is a consultant physician in Indore, told TOI. He found that the fellow flier’s pulse was missing and he was not breathing.

Heart patient out of danger after CPR

His body had also turned cold. I unbuckled his seat belt, laid him on the floor and started giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),” said the doctor. After about one and a half minutes of CPR, Ananthraman’s pulse returned and he started breathing said Dr Dubey. “As he came to his senses, I asked his name and also if he was diabetic or suffering from any other disease,” he said, adding that Ananthraman had mild fever.

On the doctor’s advice, the pilot sought permission for priority landing at Chennai, which was granted. An ambulance was waiting when the plane touched down and Ananthraman was taken to a hospital, where his condition is said to be out of danger. He had come to Indore to attend a wedding and was on his way back to Chennai. His guardian angel, Dubey, was headed for Tirupati.
