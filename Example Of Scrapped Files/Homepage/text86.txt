Bigg Boss 12 is witnessing the entry of popular celebs inside the house as the finale approaches. The house welcomed former contestants Pritam Singh and Manu Punjabi who came into the house as special guests.

In the new preview it is shown that they were given a special task wherein, Manu and Pritam asked housemates to name a person who they wish to send into the kaal kothri (jail). Surbhi took Sreesanth’s name for being aggressive and Deepak countered it saying that she can’t blame someone for aggressive when she herself does the same.

Pritam and Manu then go on to question the housemates to name a person who is dual faced and they take Karanvir Bohra’s name. Manu then suggests them to send KV to jail. This irks him and he refuses to go to jail and walks off from the living area. Currently, Karanvir doesn’t have any confidant in the house and his equation too has turned sour with most of the housemates.

Karanvir and Sreesanth were seen interacting with a popular RJ in last night’s episode (December 20). During their conversation they blamed each other for many things and even got into an argument. Karanvir even stated that Dipika Kakar has got overshadowed by Sreesanth in the game.
