In the latest episode of Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2, Mohini scolds Prerna for putting Anurag's life in danger. She tells her she will never forgive her for it. The police arrives, and Mohini tells them Naveen is on the run.


Nivedita calls Moloy but he doesn't pick. He instead arrives there with Rajesh, Anupam and Anurag. Moloy scolds Prerna for not sharing her problem with him. She tells him she tried. 

Moloy then makes her his personal assistant for a salary of Rs 50,000. He tells her she would now be able to pay off Rajesh's debt. He asks her to come at 8.30 am the next day to make arrangements for Anupam and Nivedita's first wedding anniversary.

After they leave, Nivedita challenges Mohini that Prerna is going to use her charm to attract Anurag, and before they know the matter would be out of their hands.

Anurag drops the Sharma family home. While everyone else goes to change, Prerna offers to make tea for Anurag. Shivani goes with Sid to help him park his car. Prerna aplogises to Anurag and the two share a romantic moment, which Shivani and Sid become a witness to.

Later in their room, Shivani makes Prerna confess her feelings for Anurag. While trying to sleep, Prerna and Anurag begin to think about each other. Elsewhere, Anupam is seen with Nivedita, who is least interested in their wedding anniversary.
