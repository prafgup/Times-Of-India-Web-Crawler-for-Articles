In the latest episode of Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, Bhide, Popat, Sodhi and Dr Hathi are seen happy after reading the newspaper. They meet in the society's compound and call Mehta.


Mehta is surprised to see them in a joyous mood. They show him the newspaper with good news for Jethalal. Mehta is elated, and they all decide to inform Jethalal about it. Meanwhile, Bapuji wishes 'suprabhat' to Jethalal but he is in a bad mood.

Just then, Sodhi gets the dhol and calls out Jethalal. The latter asks them not to beat the dhol as he is very unhappy. Mehta tells him there is a good news for him and calls him in the compound. Bapu Ji tags along.

Jethalal then reads that his shop at Ashok Nagar might be demolished for construction of Metro track, which implies that his selling the shop to Surma has been a profitable deal. Jethalal begins to jump with joy and tells Bapu Ji about the same. They all begin to celebrate.

Surma bhai reads the news, too. It leaves him disturbed. He consults a few people who share with him that he should stop the deal. Jethalal decides to deposit the money given by Surma in the bank, at the earliest. Surma thinks of a way to handle the situation.
