For the uninitiated, Nick Jonas zoomed off to the US post their wedding while Priyanka was here in India to complete her prior commitments. The actress joined in Nick a few days later.

The couple returned to India together as they hosted two impending grand wedding receptions, one for family and media while the other for Bollywood fraternity, which took place last night. Though the party was on till the wee hours in morning, Priyanka and Nick enjoyed were all fresh and geared up to return to their nest in the west.

The power-couple was snapped at the Mumbai airport while they were leaving India.
