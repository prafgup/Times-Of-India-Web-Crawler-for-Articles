Karisma Kapoor was extremely fond of Sridevi, who was also her all-time favourite actress, and got the opportunity of a lifetime when she starred alongside her idol in Shah Rukh Khan starrer, '
Zero'. The two have a brief cameo in the movie.

Along with Karisma and Sridevi, 'Zero' also has cameos by Kajol, Rani Mukerji and Alia Bhatt. Karisma took to Instagram today to share a behind-the-scenes photo with Sridevi from the sets of the film. In the photo, while Sridevi looked gorgeous in an emerald green sparkling gown, Karisma looked beautiful in a one-shoulder black gown. The ladies can be seen fixing their makeup before they shot for their scene. 


Karisma's caption reads as, "Thank you @iamsrk and #teamzero for giving me the opportunity to share screen space ( even if it was for a few minutes )with the legend and my all time favourite #sridevi we miss you. #specialmoments #behindthescenes #zero #releasingtoday #21stdec @redchilliesent."
