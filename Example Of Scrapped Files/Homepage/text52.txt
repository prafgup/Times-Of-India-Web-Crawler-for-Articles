His royal cuteness, Taimur Ali Khan is currently in South Africa, enjoying his birthday getaway with parents, Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan. We saw images of the toddler celebrating his birthday by the beach apart from posing with his mom and dad for some adorable frame-worthy photos. 

Among the many photos of the cutie, a video that sees him shirtless and playing in an inflatable pool is doing the rounds online. Isn’t this just the cutest video you have seen all day?
