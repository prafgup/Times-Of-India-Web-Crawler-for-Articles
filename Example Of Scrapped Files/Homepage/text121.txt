Indian badminton star, Saina Nehwal got married to her childhood sweetheart Parulpalli Kashyap on December 14, 2018. The couple hosted a reception in Hyderabad and for the occasion, the duo wore matching coloured outfits by Sabyasachi Mukherjee.





The bride wore a rich indigo velvet lehenga, which was embroidered with intricate work. It featured zardosi, applique designs encrusted with pearls and crystals. While most brides opt for red and pink hues, we loved this royal blue shade on Saina, a new trend to look forward to! 





Her look was accessorised with a pink dupatta on her head and a velvet one over her shoulders. Adding a royal touch to her ensemble was the jewellery set by Sabyasachi Heritage jewellery collection. It was encrusted with Burmese rubies, uncut diamonds and emeralds. Her make-up artist Tamanna gave her smokey bronze eyes and a matte pink lip colour, that complemented her bridal look. 



When it came to the groom, Kashyap wore a quilted indigo sherwani in hand-dyed Murshidabad silk. It was accentuated with Sabyasachi's signature Bengal tiger embossed buttons. It was paired with a tussar shawl featuring tilla work on borders. He accessorised the sherwani with a diamond and pearl necklace by Sabyasachi Heritage Jewelry collection.
