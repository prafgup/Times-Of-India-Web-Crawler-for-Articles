In the latest promo that is out on social media, it seems that Somi Khan is down with fever. Deepak asks Surbhi if Somi has high fever and Surbhi gets worried for her. She takes care of Somi like an elder sister and asks her to drink milk and then have medicines. 

Surbhi treats Somi like her younger sister and calls herself 'appi' (elder sister). Surbhi kisses Somi and wishes her to get well soon. 

The video is captioned as "#SomiKhan is like a younger sister to #SurbhiRana in the #BB12 house and she cares for her in an adorable way too! #BiggBoss12". Surbhi tells Somi that she is possessive for her and at times she even gets jealous.
