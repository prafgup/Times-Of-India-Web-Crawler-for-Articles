Hina was the runner-up in Khatron Ke Khiladi 8, which was eventually won by Shantanu Maheshewari. Her performance on the show was applause-worthy. 

Currently, the actress is shooting for Kasautii Zindagii Kay where she will return as Komolika after her brief appearance earlier. She recently shared her new look from the show with her fans, and also a fresh teaser on her Instagram account. 

These days, Hina is also sporting a shorter hairstyle in real life, which has been given a thumbs-up by her fans.
