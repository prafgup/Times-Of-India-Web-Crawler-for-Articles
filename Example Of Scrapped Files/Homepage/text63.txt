While actor Vijay Sethupathi's 'Seethakaathi' directed by Balaji Tharaneetharan has been receiving good response from the audience and critics, the film seems to have been leaked online by the popular 
Tamilrockers website that hosts pirated copies of films.

While the TFPC (Tamil Film Producers Council) claims to be taking steps to curb the piracy for the film, there have also been recent allegations that TFPC president Vishal is having a share in the piracy website TamilRockers. The piracy website is responsible for leaking several big films this year including Rajinikanth's '2.0' and Aamir Khan's 'Thugs of Hindostan'. 

'Seethakaathi' starring Vijay Sethupathi and Ramya Nambeesan in the lead hit the screens yesterday, 20th December. The star actor plays the role of 'Ayya', a 70 year old theater artiste and the three minute long trailer shows glimpses of the issues he faces. The film is touted to be a soulful film and will be 25th film of Vijay Sethupathi which conveys the message that art has no boundaries and it is immortal as it will live through someone or the other.
