MOSCOW: A Soyuz spacecraft ferrying Russian, German and US astronauts from the International Space Station landed safely on Thursday in Kazakhstan, Russia's space agency said.


"There's been a landing... The crew of the manned Soyuz MS-09 has returned safely to Earth after 197 days," Roscosmos said on Twitter.

The spacecraft carrying Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency, NASA's Serena Aunon-Chancellor and Sergey Prokopyev of Roscosmos landed slightly ahead of schedule at 0802 Moscow time (0502 GMT), Roscosmos said on its website.
